## Problem 1: The Birthday Presents Party (50 points)
The Minotaur’s birthday party was a success. The Minotaur received a lot of presents
from his guests. The next day he decided to sort all of his presents and start writing
“Thank you” cards. Every present had a tag with a unique number that was associated
with the guest who gave it. Initially all of the presents were thrown into a large bag with
no particular order. The Minotaur wanted to take the presents from this unordered bag
and create a chain of presents hooked to each other with special links (similar to storing
elements in a linked-list). In this chain (linked-list) all of the presents had to be ordered
according to their tag numbers in increasing order. The Minotaur asked 4 of his servants
to help him with creating the chain of presents and writing the cards to his guests. Each
servant would do one of three actions in no particular order: 1. Take a present from the
unordered bag and add it to the chain in the correct location by hooking it to the
predecessor’s link. The servant also had to make sure that the newly added present is
also linked with the next present in the chain. 2. Write a “Thank you” card to a guest and
remove the present from the chain. To do so, a servant had to unlink the gift from its
predecessor and make sure to connect the predecessor’s link with the next gift in the
chain. 3. Per the Minotaur’s request, check whether a gift with a particular tag was
present in the chain or not; without adding or removing a new gift, a servant would scan
through the chain and check whether a gift with a particular tag is already added to the
ordered chain of gifts or not. As the Minotaur was impatient to get this task done
quickly, he instructed his servants not to wait until all of the presents from the
unordered bag are placed in the chain of linked and ordered presents. Instead, every
servant was asked to alternate adding gifts to the ordered chain and writing “Thank you”
cards. The servants were asked not to stop or even take a break until the task of writing
cards to all of the Minotaur’s guests was complete. After spending an entire day on this
task the bag of unordered presents and the chain of ordered presents were both finally
empty! Unfortunately, the servants realized at the end of the day that they had more
presents than “Thank you” notes. What could have gone wrong? Can we help the
Minotaur and his servants improve their strategy for writing “Thank you” notes? Design
and implement a concurrent linked-list that can help the Minotaur’s 4 servants with this
task. In your test, simulate this concurrent “Thank you” card writing scenario by
dedicating 1 thread per servant and assuming that the Minotaur received 500,000
presents from his guests.

## Solution:
